# Vessels-orientation-
Create a polar histogram to illustrate the vessel orientation of an image based on vessel length previously calculated (by yourself). 
The vessels running tangential to the surface of the cortex are represented in the 45° (35–55°) and 225° (215–240°) angle ranges (yellow lines on your excel sheet).
